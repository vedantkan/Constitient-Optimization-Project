**Optimizing mixture constituents to minimize corrosion**

•	Implemented machine learning techniques in R to predict corrosion of surface coating, utilizing Bayesian models to study posterior uncertainty in noise, achieving 92% prediction accuracy.
•	Presented a detailed report to PPG industries highlighting major results, findings, important variables, and recommended input setting that minimized surface corrosion. 

The output and the inputs shows linear relationship.

But as we categorize by the machine variable the output and the inputs shows non-linear relationship.
